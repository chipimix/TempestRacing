        <h1> Brain Metrics</h1>
        <li>
            <h3>Engagement</h3>
            <p>Similar to focus, it translates the subject's involvement in the task at hand. Reflects the processes of information-gathering, visual scanning, and sustained attention. Usually more elevated in high-intensity game events (e.g. team fights) than general gameplay.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Emotional Valence</h3>
            <p>Refers to the pleasantness or unpleasantness of an emotional stimulus. Can be positive, neutral, or negative, and translates feelings of attraction (positive) or rejection (negative) towards the stimuli. Usually decreases during and after death events when compared to general gameplay events.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Stress</h3>
            <p>Reflects stress derived from the mental effort required to perform the tasks at hand. Higher stress levels correlate with harder task difficulty.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Sleepiness</h3>
            <p>Related to an increase in drowsiness and fatigue from long play sessions. If continually increasing can indicate a good time for a short break.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Focus</h3>
            <p>Reflects states of enhanced arousal and focused attention. Related to complex information processing.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Memory Load</h3>
            <p>Translates the cognitive load allocated to working memory tasks. Working memory refers to the limited capacity for holding information in mind for several seconds (short-term memory). Overload of working memory can lead to an increased number of performance errors.</p>
        </li>
        <h1> Heart Metrics</h1>

        <li>
            <h3>Heart rate</h3>
            <p>Average heart rate (in beats per minute). Tends to increase in high-intensity moments of gameplay.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>HRV</h3>
            <p>Heart rate variability is the fluctuation of the length of heartbeat intervals, and so it represents the ability of the heart to respond to a variety of physiological and environmental stimuli. In general, having a higher HRV translates to higher resilience to stress.</p>
        </li>
        <h1> Interaction Metrics</h1>

        <li>
            <h3>Actions per Minute</h3>
            <p>Consists in the number of keyboard strokes, mouse moves and mouse clicks per minute.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Mouse Activity</h3>
            <p>Similar to APM but takes only into account an average of the number of mouse moves and mouse clicks with more weight to the mouse moves.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3>Fatigue</h3>
            <p>Measures consistency and variability between consecutive interactions with the mouse and keyboard while also taking into account the current APM value. Works best for longer recordings as it requires a moderate amount of interactions.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
